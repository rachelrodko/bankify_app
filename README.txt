# Bankify App
#### (JavaScript)

I created an example online banking application as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript Course on Udemy. It has given me strong grounding in the JavaScript fundamentals, especially in the use of arrays and array methods (map, find, reduce and filter, sort, forEach) and manipulating the DOM.

## How it works

For testing purposes I have created two accounts (js and jd) who can log into the app. There is a verification check whereby only the correct username and password can log in. If the correct username and password match this will unlock the UI of a made-up online banking app. Each user can tranfer money to the other user and this will immediately show in their list of transactions as a deposit or withdrawal respectively. Each user can also request a loan from the bank and this will be added to their transactions as a deposit. There are checks that a user cannot transfer money below £0.00 and that a user cannot transfer more than their bank balance. A transfer or loan will automatically update the summary of each user's online transactions and their overall bank balance and the transfer of money will be visible to the other user as a deposit when s/he logs in to their account. The transactions can be sorted into chronological order or transaction type. There is also a timer in place that will automatically log out the user after 5 minutes.
